# HackThisSite CVE IRC Announcer

*A tiny IRC bot that announces new/updated CVEs*

## How to use

Make sure you have [composer](https://getcomposer.org/) installed. In the project directory, run `php composer.phar install` to fetch the required dependencies.

Then, copy `config.example.ini` to `config.ini` and make sure to edit and set everything in it before running the bot.

To run the bot, execute `cve-bot.php` within the bot's root directory as a daemon.  In FreeBSD, for example, you can do so as follows:

    daemon -p bot.pid php cve-bot.php

## FAQ

* **Why did you write this in PHP?  Why not *[other language]*?**
  * We already had great experience with the ProtoIRC framework for our Nagios bot, so continuing to use this framework was a natural choice.

* **Why did you use MagpieRSS instead of *[other library]*?**
  * Because it's very simple and it works effectively.

* **Why did you not use *[insert coding standard]*?**
  * Because this is a prototype/proof-of-concept.  If you desperately want it to be PSR-4 or Composer-ready, by all means feel free to do so and submit a pull request.

## TODO

* Currently the bot polls every half-hour by default for new CVEs, but apparently NIST updates their RSS feed once per day.  Due to the throttling implemented, by default the bot will announce 3 CVEs and nothing else.  If there are more CVEs, they go ignored.  This should be changed so the bot adds them to a buffer that gets announced over time (e.g. one CVE per half-hour).

* The bot currently does not respond to user commands, but it would be useful if it could do so, such as giving some basic information about a CVE when asked (ex. `!cve CVE-2016-4012` will trigger the bot to look up that CVE and provide some basic details and a URL to the NIST page).

* General debugging and tweaking needs done to make the bot more robust (e.g. not exiting when it loses connectivity for a long enough time)
