# HackThisSite CVE IRC Announcer

*A tiny IRC bot that announces new/updated CVEs*

## How to use

First, copy `config.example.ini` to `config.ini` and make sure to edit and set everything in it before running the bot.

To run the bot, execute `cve-bot.php` within the bot's root directory as a daemon.  In FreeBSD, for example, you can do so as follows:

    daemon -p bot.pid php cve-bot.php

## FAQ

* **Why did you write this in PHP?  Why not *[other language]*?**
  * We already had great experience with the ProtoIRC framework for our Nagios bot, so continuing to use this framework was a natural choice.

* **Why did you use MagpieRSS instead of *[other library]*?**
  * Because it's very simple and it works effectively.

* **Why did you not use *[insert coding standard]*?**
  * Because this is a prototype/proof-of-concept.  If you desperately want it to be PSR-4 or Composer-ready, by all means feel free to do so and submit a pull request.

## Changelog

* **Version 1.0** - Initial release
